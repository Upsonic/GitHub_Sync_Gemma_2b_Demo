<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The `math.basics` library appears to contain fundamental mathematical operations, such as subtraction and addition. The two functions defined in this library are `sub`, which performs integer subtraction, and `sum`, which adds two numbers together. These basic arithmetic operations can be used as building blocks for more complex calculations or data processing tasks.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The `math.basics` library provides a set of basic mathematical functions, including subtraction (`sub`) and addition (`sum`). The primary aim of this library is to provide simple, intuitive, and reusable code for performing common arithmetic operations. These functions can be used in various scenarios where you need to perform elementary mathematical calculations, such as data processing, scientific applications, or even everyday programming tasks. By providing these fundamental building blocks, the `math.basics` library aims to simplify the development process and facilitate more efficient coding practices.
