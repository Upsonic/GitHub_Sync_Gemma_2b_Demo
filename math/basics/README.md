<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>Sure, here's a few explanation about the purpose of the 'math.basics' library and its elements:

**Purpose:**

The 'math.basics' library provides basic mathematical functions and constants that are often used in mathematics and computer science. This library helps developers write cleaner and more efficient code by providing commonly used functions in a readily available format.

**Elements:**

The library contains a single function named `sum` that allows you to calculate the sum of two numbers. It also defines an `int` variable called `math.basics.sum` that represents the sum of two numbers.

**In summary, the purpose of the 'math.basics' library is to:**

* Provide a set of commonly used mathematical functions.
* Simplify code by eliminating the need to write repetitive mathematical expressions.
* Facilitate the development of efficient and maintainable programs.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The provided code defines a Python function named `math.basics.sum` that demonstrates basic mathematical operations and functions within a Python library called `math.basics`. This library provides a set of basic mathematical functions and operations that can be used for numerical calculations.

Here's a summary of the code:

1. **Function Definition**: The `sum` function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns the sum of these two numbers.
2. **Input Variables**: `a` and `b` are the two numbers whose sum is to be calculated.
3. **Operation**: The code uses the `+` operator to add the values of `a` and `b` together and returns the result.
4. **Logic**: The function utilizes the `+` operator to perform an addition operation and returns the outcome.
5. **Usage**: The `math.basics.sum` function can be used to calculate the sum of two numbers by passing their values as arguments.

Overall, this code showcases how to define and use functions and basic mathematical operations within the `math.basics` library for numerical calculations.
