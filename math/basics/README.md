<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The `math.basics` library appears to provide fundamental mathematical operations, such as subtraction (`sub`) and addition (`sum`). The purpose of these functions is to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numerical inputs. These operations can be used in various scenarios where simple calculations are needed, such as data processing or scientific applications.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The `math.basics` library appears to be a collection of basic mathematical functions that provide simple arithmetic operations, such as subtraction (`sub`) and addition (`sum`). The primary aim of this library is to provide a set of reusable functions for performing common mathematical calculations, making it easier to write concise and efficient code. By providing these fundamental building blocks, developers can focus on more complex problems while relying on the library for basic arithmetic operations.
