<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'math.basics' library appears to be a simple implementation of basic mathematical operations, specifically subtraction and addition. Its purpose is likely to provide a foundation for more complex mathematical functions or to serve as a building block for more advanced calculations. The two main elements, `sub` and `sum`, are straightforward implementations of these fundamental arithmetic operations, allowing users to perform simple calculations in a concise manner.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The `math.basics` library appears to be a collection of basic mathematical functions, specifically designed for simplicity and ease of use. Its primary purpose is to provide a set of fundamental arithmetic operations that can be used as building blocks for more complex calculations. The two main elements of this library are the `sub` (subtraction) function, which takes two numbers as input and returns their difference, and the `sum` (addition) function, which adds its two inputs together. These basic functions serve as a foundation for more advanced mathematical operations, allowing users to perform simple calculations with ease.
