<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The purpose of this 'math' library is to provide basic mathematical functions and operations for numerical calculations. The elements of this library include functions that perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and other mathematical operations on numbers. By utilizing these functions, programmers can easily perform mathematical calculations and solve problems involving numbers.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>Sure, here's a summary of the code and its elements:

The `math.basics.sum` module defines a function named `sum` that allows you to calculate the sum of two numbers. The function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and utilizes the built-in '+' operator to add these two numbers together. The module also includes an input variable, `a`, which represents the first number to be added, and another input variable, `b`, which represents the second number to be added. The code defines a single output variable, `sum`, which will store the result of the addition.

This code provides a basic arithmetic function for addition, which can be used to solve simple mathematical problems.
