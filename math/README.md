<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The `math` library appears to be a collection of basic mathematical functions, including subtraction (`sub`), addition (`sum`), and multiplication (`mul`). The purpose of this library is likely to provide a set of reusable and straightforward functions for performing common arithmetic operations. By encapsulating these fundamental calculations into distinct functions, the library allows developers to focus on more complex problems without having to reimplement basic math operations from scratch.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The "math" library appears to be a basic arithmetic operations library for Python, providing functions for subtraction (sub), addition (sum), and multiplication (mul). The purpose of this library is to provide a simple and intuitive way to perform common mathematical operations, making it easier to write code that requires these calculations. By using the provided functions, developers can avoid writing their own implementations of these basic arithmetic operations, which can help reduce errors and increase code readability.
