<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The `math` library appears to be a collection of basic mathematical functions, such as subtraction (`sub`), addition (`sum`), and multiplication (`mul`). The purpose of this library is likely to provide a set of simple arithmetic operations that can be used in various programming scenarios where numerical calculations are necessary. These elements (functions) can be used to perform common mathematical tasks, such as calculating totals, averages, or sums, and scaling values.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The `math` library appears to be a collection of basic mathematical functions, including subtraction (`sub`), addition (`sum`), and multiplication (`mul`). The primary aim of this library is to provide simple, elementary arithmetic operations that can be used to perform calculations on numerical values. These functions can be useful in various scenarios where basic mathematical operations are needed, such as data processing, scientific applications, or everyday computations.
