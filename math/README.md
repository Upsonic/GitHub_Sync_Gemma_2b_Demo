<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'math' library is a collection of basic mathematical functions written in Python. Its primary purpose is to provide simple arithmetic operations such as subtraction, addition, and multiplication, which can be used to perform common mathematical tasks. The elements of this library include the sub(), sum(), and mul() functions, each designed to perform a specific mathematical operation: subtraction, addition, and multiplication respectively. These functions can be used to calculate the difference between two numbers, add two numbers together, or multiply two numbers, making it a convenient tool for performing everyday math tasks in Python programming.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The `math` library appears to provide a set of basic mathematical operations as functions, namely `sub`, `sum`, and `mul`. The purpose of these functions is to simplify arithmetic calculations by providing a structured way to perform common operations such as subtraction, addition, and multiplication. This can be useful in various programming scenarios where simple math operations are needed, making the code more readable and maintainable.
