<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The `math` library appears to be a collection of basic mathematical functions, providing elementary operations such as subtraction, addition, and multiplication. The three functions included - `sub`, `sum`, and `mul` - allow for the calculation of differences, sums, and products between two numerical input values. These functions serve as building blocks for more complex mathematical computations or data processing tasks, offering a foundation for arithmetic operations in Python programming.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The `math` library, as evident from its three basic functions (`sub`, `sum`, and `mul`), appears to be designed for performing elementary mathematical operations. Its primary aim is to provide a set of simple functions that can be used to perform arithmetic operations such as subtraction, addition, and multiplication on numerical values. These functions are likely intended to be used in various applications where basic mathematical calculations are required, such as data processing, scientific simulations, or general-purpose programming.
