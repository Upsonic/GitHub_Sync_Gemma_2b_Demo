<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The `math.normal` library appears to be a Python module that provides basic mathematical functions for normalizing or manipulating numerical values. The specific element mentioned, `mul`, is a function that performs multiplication on two input values. This suggests that the library may also include other normalization-related functions, such as mean calculation, standard deviation computation, or possibly even statistical distribution generation. Overall, the purpose of this library seems to be providing utility functions for working with numerical data in Python programming.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The `math.normal` library is not a standard Python library, but rather a custom library or module that provides basic mathematical functions. The `mul` function, specifically, aims to provide a simple way to multiply two numbers together. Its usage aim is to enable developers to easily calculate the product of two input values within their own code. In other words, this function serves as a utility for performing multiplication operations in Python programming.
