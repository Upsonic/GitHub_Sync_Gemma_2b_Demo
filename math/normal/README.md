<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The `math.normal.mul` function appears to be part of a Python library called `math.normal`. The purpose of this library is likely to provide basic mathematical operations, such as multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division. In this specific case, the `mul` function allows you to multiply two numbers together. The name "normal" suggests that this library may also include functions for calculating statistical mean values or normal distributions, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided summary.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The `math.normal.mul` function is part of a Python library called `math.normal`, which appears to be a module for performing basic mathematical operations. The primary aim of this library is to provide simple, straightforward functions for common arithmetic tasks, such as multiplication, addition, and possibly other mathematical operations. In this specific case, the `mul` function is designed to multiply two input numbers together and return the result. This suggests that the library is intended to be a utility tool for performing quick calculations or prototyping mathematical ideas in Python.
